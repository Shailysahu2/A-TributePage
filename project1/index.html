            A Brief Summary of gandhi's journey
        </h1>
        <h2><u><b>Early Life and Family Background</b></u></h2>
        <p>He was born on 2 October, 1869 in Porbandar, Gujarat. His father’s name was Karamchand Gandhi and his
            mother’s name was Putlibai. At the age of 13, Mahatma Gandhi was married to Kasturba which is an arranged
            marriage. They had four sons namely Harilal, Manilal, Ramdas and Devdas. She supported all the endeavors of
            her husband until her death in 1944.</p>
        <p>His father was Dewan or Chief Minister of Porbandar, the capital of a small principality in Western British
            India (Now Gujarat State). Mahatma Gandhi was the son of his father's fourth wife Putlibai, who belonged to
            an affluent Vaishnava family. Let us tell you that in his earlier days, he was deeply influenced by the
            stories of Shravana and Harishchandra as they reflected the importance of truth.</p>

        <h2><u><b> Education </b></u></h2>
        <p>When Gandhi was 9 years old he went to a local school at Rajkot and studied the basics of arithmetic,
            history, geography, and languages. At the age of 11, he went to a high school in Rajkot. Because of his
            wedding, at least about one year, his studies were disturbed and later he joined and completed his
            schooling. He joined Samaldas college in Bhavnagar in 1888 at Gujarat. Later, one of his family friends
            Mavji Dave Joshi pursued further studies i.e. law in London. Gandhiji was not satisfied with his studies at
            Samaldas College and so he became excited by the London proposal and managed to convince his mother and wife
            that he will not touch non-veg, wine, or women.</p>
        <h3><b>Off to London</b></h3>
        <p>In the year 1888, Mahatma Gandhi left for London to study law. Thereafter 10 days after arrival, he joined
            the Inner Temple, one of the four London law colleges, and studied and practiced law. In London, he also
            joined a Vegetarian Society and was introduced to Bhagavad Gita by some of his vegetarian friends. Later,
            Bhagavad Gita set an impression and influenced his life.</p>
